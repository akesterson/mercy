Mercy is a web application designed to facilitate payments between people who need prescriptions but can't afford them, and charitable people who can afford them

The Idea
========

* Patient: "Here's my prescription, Mr Pharmacist"
* Pharmacist: "Sure thing. That'll be $150 USD."
* Patient: "I can't afford that! Can you submit it to Mercy for me?"
* Pharmacist: "Sure thing. We'll call you when it gets filled."

... Meanwhile, back at stately Charitable Person Manor ...

* Charitable Person's Phone: *DING*
* Charitable Person: "Huh? Oh! Mercy is telling me there's a new prescription I can pay for. I love helping people!"
* Charitable person clicks some buttons
* Charitable Person: "*CLICK* Paid! Enjoy some good health, stranger. Now to post it on my facebook wall and collect the new achievement for buying my first Leukemia drug..."

... Back at the pharmacy ...

* Pharmacist : "Hello, Patient? I just wanted to let you know that your prescription is filled and has been paid in full."
* Patient: "That's so great! I'll come pick it up right away. Now I won't die because my medication is too *!#&$# expensive!"

Then everyone rides dinosaurs into the sunset, happy and healthy. It's pretty awesome.

(That's the idea anyway. WE'll see if reality follows.)
