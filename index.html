<a name="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Current Status of The Mercy Project</h3>

To prevent confusion, as you read through this document, here is the current state of The Mercy Project.

The Mercy Project has just begun. We have a skeleton application which can populate and query a PostgreSQL database with FDA and (some) DrugBank data. There is no web application yet, aside from the flask-sqlalchemy framework. We are not yet ready to provide this product to the pharmacy, the patients, or the donors. THe project exists, aside from some amount of skeleton code, inside the project's GitHub roadmap. We are currently looking for lots of talented technical help so that we can move down that roadmap and get this application up and running, and then market it to pharmacies.

<a name="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Problem</h3>

<p>Every year more and more low and middle income Americans are choosing not to fill their prescriptions, or to take less than the required dosage to make them last longer. This is because of several factors, all of which boil down to the prescriptions being entirely too expensive. Some people report having to make major lifestyle changes to afford medications, while others choose to go without entirely. These drugs range the gamut from blood pressure medications to mental health medications. And this is not a problem that is the exclusive realm of the very poor; the lower and middle classes suffer similarly - some of which, ironically, are "too wealthy" to qualify for state programs, or who qualify for the programs, but for whom the prescriptions are still too expensive due to extreme poverty.

<p>We, as a nation, are choosing to be sick because we cannot afford to be healthy. This must end. We must find some way to help.

<h3>
<a name="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Mercy Project : Helping Pay for Prescriptions</h3>

<p>What if it was easy for us to help people pay for their medications? What if helping a fellow human being live a longer, healthier life was as simple as issuing a Reddit Upvote or a Facebook Like? What if it could be done without people having to feel exposed and ashamed? What if it could be done without limiting charity to the physical region around the people who need help, and that help could come in from anywhere that the Internet could reach?

<p>The Mercy Project is a potential answer to this idea. The Mercy Project hopes to create a platform on which prescriptions can be listed anonymously, by participating pharmacies, and which can then be paid (partially or in full) by generous donors.

<ul>
<li>The experience is anonymous for the patient, and simple; The Mercy Project would provide all necessary integration with pharmacies to allow them to submit prescriptions anonymously. When the prescription is paid, The Mercy Project platform automatically notifies the pharmacy, which can then contact and dispense the pharmaceuticals to the patient. None of the patient's identifying information is ever recorded or asked for by Mercy; all that Mercy ever knows about a prescription is which pharmacy it came from, and a prescription ID number.</li><br/>

<li>The experience is secure and legal; only accredited physical and online pharmacies, pharmacists and technicians, licensed in the United States, would be allowed to participate in the program.</li><br/>

<li>The experience is fast and simple for the donor; by simply scrolling through a list of prescriptions on the front page. - each one with the name of the drug, the cost, and a brief blurb about what the drug treats - the donor can easily understand what is being requested, and can make an informed choice about which drugs they choose to help pay for, and which ones they do not.</li><br/>

<li>The experience is as informative for the donor as it is helpful for the patient. Each prescription, as previously mentioned, briefly describes what it treats; but it also links to information about the drug on Wikipedia, as well as providing information about who manufactures and packages the drug. This information comes from the United States Food and Drug Administration, and the Drug Bank, and is always kept up to date.</li><br/>

<li>The donor can choose to pay for a portion, or the entirety, of one or several prescriptions. Or they can choose to donate a lump sum, and The Mercy Project will automatically distribute the lump sum.</li><br/>

<li>The donation process can be as public or as private as the donor wants. Do you prefer to perform your acts of charity quietly and secretly in the night, like a benevolent Batman of charity? Or do you prefer to share your goodwill with your friends and family via social media? Do you like the idea of becoming a top contributor and being listed on the front page? The Mercy Project will support and integrate with social media networks to let you contribute your way.</li><br/>

<li>Corporations will be given a chance to show how much they care for the forgotten and underserved; corporate donations to The Mercy Project will automatically place their logo on the frontpage along with top contributing donors. Do you want to be a company that supports Mercy?</li><br/>

<li>The payments will be secure and reliable. The Mercy Project will partner with Amazon, Google and Paypal's checkout APIs, so that the donor can use whichever payment they are most comfortable with; and further, The Mercy Project will never have to store any sensitive customer information, instead offloading those heavyweight security tasks to companies much better suited to the task. This will allow The Mercy Project to focus on being an effective charity, rather than learning how to be a merchant data manager.</li><br/>
</ul>

<a name="rather-drive-stick" class="anchor" href="#rather-drive-stick"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How can I help launch this project?</h3>

This project is incredibly ambitious, and will require lots and lots of hard work. We are currently building the technology stack behind The Mercy Project, and as such, we could really use your help if you have any of these skills:

<ul>
<li>Quality Assurance and Software Testing (This application needs to be tested by humans!)</li>
<li>Database design and optimization (PostgreSQL, also being familiar with ORM as it effects DB design is helpful)</li>
<li>Frontend web design and user interface creation (HTML/CSS/Javascript/etc)</li>
<li>Backend web application development (Python/Django/Flask/SQLAlchemy)</li>
<li>Highly available cloud application deployment and operations (Ubuntu Linux/Puppet/Monitoring/Cloud Ops)</li>
</ul>

<p>If you fit any of these qualifications, then you are highly encouraged to browse over to <a href="https://www.github.com/akesterson/mercy/issues">The Open Issues at The Mercy Project on GitHub</a>, and join the discussion! We are more than eager to accept ideas, help, pull requests, or just plain support.

<a name="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Legal Advice</h3>

<p>If you are a person with experience in HIPAA or other medical related law fields, and would like to offer your advice to The Mercy Project, <b>we would love to have your help</b>. This project was started by a software developer, not a lawyer.

<h3>
<a name="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why the focus on America?</h3>

<p>Because the project was started by an American, and this was the environment into which they thought they could most immediately introduce the project and achieve results.

<p>This is by no means an American problem. This is a global issue. However, the administrative and legal challenges faced by this project are quite large enough even with the scope limited to the United States. If we tried to start the project with an international focus, it would have absolutely no hope of lifting off the ground. It would collapse under its own weight.
